This repository contains the source code for a couple of microcontrollers,
sensors and other ICs implementing a digital twin of the [Smart City Kempten (Allg√§u)](https://smartes.kempten.de/)
as a LEGO model, located at the "Zukunftslabor" in Kempten.

The model was built by Marius Herrmann (https://steponabrick.com,
info@steponabrick.com), the electronics and software was implemented by me
(Thomas Herrmann, mail@thoherr.de).

The basic design of the software and it's configuration is documented in [docs/SOFTWARE](docs/SOFTWARE.md).
