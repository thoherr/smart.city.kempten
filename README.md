# smart.city.kempten

This repository contains the source code for a couple of microcontrollers,
sensors and other ICs implementing a digital twin of the City of Kempten (Allg√§u)
as a LEGO model.

The model was built by Marius Herrmann (https://steponabrick.com,
info@steponabrick.com), the electronics and software was implemented by me
(Thomas Herrmann, mail@thoherr.de).

The wiring of the model is documented as circuit diagrams in the docs folder, see
[wiring_inner_city_1.pdf](docs/wiring_inner_city_1.pdf),
[wiring_inner_city_2.pdf](docs/wiring_inner_city_2.pdf) and
TBD.
